&lt;p&gt;He presents it in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_History_of_Mindfulness_Bhikkhu_Sujato.pdf&quot;&gt;A History of Mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, in which he traces the development of the idea of mindfulness and its eventual expression in the satipaṭṭhāna literature.  The first half of the book is devoted to his proposition of a theory to explain the earliest development of Buddhist teachings, which he refers to as the GIST theory:  The General Integrated Sutta Theory.  To come up with it, he looks at three strata of early literature:  The suttas themselves, the collections of suttas, and the Abhidhamma, and considers them independently to see what light they shed on the origin of the canon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the level of the collection of the suttas the most interesting.  He proposes that the first collection was four of the five Vaggas of the Saṃyutta Nikāya/Saṃyukta Āgama.  He suggests the Four Noble Truths provided a scaffolding for the core organization of the suttas, and from there, the other collections and longer suttas were composed and built.  He also proposes that some of the earliest Abhidhamma literature, such as the &lt;em&gt;Vibhaṅga&lt;/em&gt;, predates the later Nikāya literature, such as the &lt;em&gt;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to be able to carry out statistical studies to flesh out these ideas a bit more.  I anticipate another year of learning before being able to do this, though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m not immersed enough in the scholarship of Buddhism to know how whack Bhante Sujato’s GIST theory is, but I find it interesting, and it’s part of what motivated me to take on this project in the first place.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What’s this all about?</title><link href="//navabhidhamma/intro/2019/06/15/what-is-this.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What's this all about?" /><published>2019-06-15T11:27:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-15T11:27:00-04:00</updated><id>//navabhidhamma/intro/2019/06/15/what-is-this</id><content type="html" xml:base="//navabhidhamma/intro/2019/06/15/what-is-this.html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I updated the About and Index pages, so that should sum up what I’m doing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the best thing now would be to simply outline my academic-ish goals (I doubt I’ll ever be involved in academia proper again) as far as Buddhist studies goes.  I should emphasize that I am a practitioner, as well, so my central goal in all of this is to provide illumination for further practice that could be helpful to those who engage the material on an intellectual level.  Of course, that is dangerous, because it’s easy for us to get caught up in our ideas and lose the practice…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I would like primarily to be deeply familiar with the EBTs, whether in Pāli, Sanskrit, Chinese, or Tibetan…or Gandhāri or any other language.  Pāli is, of course, my starting point, but I intend to avail myself of Bhante Bhikkhu Anālayo’s research some time in the future of this project.  Ideally, I’d find a way to tie this in with Ajahn Bhikkhu Sujato’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suttacentral.net&quot;&gt;Sutta Central&lt;/a&gt;.  I would like a broader familiarity with the early schools, in part because of how they shed light on what was being thought about the original teachings, in part because of how they contribute to the rise of Mahāyāna, and in part because of my own practice.  I would like to be conversant in Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, and in their Chinese (and Chinese-influenced) and Tibetan elaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current to-do list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish the early suttas (perhaps read the rest of the canon?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish the Pāli reader (after which perhaps I’ll be ready to start in earnest)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read:  &lt;em&gt;The Buddhist Path of Awakening&lt;/em&gt; by Gethin, Ven Anālayo’s &lt;em&gt;From Craving to Grasping&lt;/em&gt; and the next volume, &lt;em&gt;The Great Disciples of the Buddha&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Life of the Buddha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
