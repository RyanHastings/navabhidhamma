And I’ve decided on the latter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided that a bit of a tour through the major forms of Buddhism would be helpful for informing the core project.  This way, I will see the various ways the original teachings have been amplified, or re-arranged, and how emphases have shifted over the centuries.  I will be able to trace the development from the nuggets in the Sutta Piṭaka to their expression throughout Tibet and East Asia.  This will provide an interesting context for returning to the EBTs after this (probably years-long) intellectual journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, then, the plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish the EBTs.  I am currently on the Saṃyutta Nikāya.  First task is to finish these.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish some other preliminary stuff.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Disciples of the Buddha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Life of the Buddha&lt;/em&gt; (Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Buddhist Path of Awakening&lt;/em&gt; (Gethin)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Craving to Grasping&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;From Grasping to Emptiness&lt;/em&gt; (Bhikkhu Anālayo)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exploration of Theravāda.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abhidhamma Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Guide to the Abhidhamma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concept and Reality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Path of Purification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Early Buddhist Schools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indian Mahāyāna:  The Sūtras, Madhyāmaka and Yogācārā, Tathāgathagarbha, and any related topics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indian Tantra.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;East Asian Buddhism.  Start with China, then look at Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, I’ll be able to return to the EBTs with a great deal of context.  The plan is to become conversant in each of these, and not an expert.  Maybe the level of knowledge a Ph.D. might have.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">For awhile, I’ve been wondering whether I want to focus exclusively on the EBTs, or if I want to take a tour through the major forms of Buddhism before returning focus there.

In it, Karpik lays out an argument that the theory that Pāli originated as a mixture of local dialects in which the Buddha’s teachings were transmitted is incorrect, and that, in fact, the language we now call Pāli pre-existed the Buddha, and is the language in which the Buddha taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He begins by considering a few pieces of evidence that have been used to construct what he refers to as the MOTT, Multiple Oral Transmission Theory, instead forwarding a SOTT, Single Oral Transmission Theory.  The basic argument is that the Buddha would have encountered a number of different Prakrits (whether they be called languages or dialects seems somewhat arbitrary) while wandering over the expanse of central India that he did, and that he would have translated his teachings into these local languages (or would have otherwise had his teaching translated).  Only later was a hybrid, artificial language, which we now call Pāli, constructed for transmission of the Buddha’s teachings.  This is bolstered by a passage in the MN in which the Buddha seemingly instructs his disciples to teach in the local languages.  After this evidence is examined and rejected, he concludes by arguing that a trade language common to the area where the Buddha roamed must have already existed by simple necessity of the social and economic situation of the time, and the Buddha simply used that language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to the idea that he would have translated his teachings is that it would have been necessary.  However, the differences in the Prakrits seems to have more to do with accent and local turns of phrase than anything that would render them mutually unintelligible and thus necessitating translation.  Moreover, aping the local tongue might even produce a comical or satirical effect (consider how such a thing plays out today).  Given that the Buddha would almost certainly have been understood, the idea of multiple language transmission is unnecessary.  The scriptural evidence in favor of this is shown to be somewhat flimsy, as several different interpretations of the text can be found, all of which are more likely than the MOTT interpretation.  Indeed, there is scriptural evidence supporting the idea that the Buddha’s teachings are to be memorized down to the syllable, in support of a SOTT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, common culture was shared by the areas in which the Buddha roamed, so there is good reason to think a common dialect (or sociolect) would have existed that the Buddha could have employed.  Karpik lays out several arguments as to why it would have the features of Pāli, generally regarded to be a Western dialect of Indo-Aryan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the text gives a pretty compelling argument for Pāli being the language of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I just finished reading The Buddha Taught in Pali: A working hypothesis by Stefan Karpik, published in the Journal of the Oxford Centre of Buddhist Studies this year (2019).

&lt;p&gt;He presents it in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_History_of_Mindfulness_Bhikkhu_Sujato.pdf&quot;&gt;A History of Mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, in which he traces the development of the idea of mindfulness and its eventual expression in the satipaṭṭhāna literature.  The first half of the book is devoted to his proposition of a theory to explain the earliest development of Buddhist teachings, which he refers to as the GIST theory:  The General Integrated Sutta Theory.  To come up with it, he looks at three strata of early literature:  The suttas themselves, the collections of suttas, and the Abhidhamma, and considers them independently to see what light they shed on the origin of the canon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the level of the collection of the suttas the most interesting.  He proposes that the first collection was four of the five Vaggas of the Saṃyutta Nikāya/Saṃyukta Āgama.  He suggests the Four Noble Truths provided a scaffolding for the core organization of the suttas, and from there, the other collections and longer suttas were composed and built.  He also proposes that some of the earliest Abhidhamma literature, such as the &lt;em&gt;Vibhaṅga&lt;/em&gt;, predates the later Nikāya literature, such as the &lt;em&gt;Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to be able to carry out statistical studies to flesh out these ideas a bit more.  I anticipate another year of learning before being able to do this, though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m not immersed enough in the scholarship of Buddhism to know whether or not Bhante Sujato’s GIST theory is completely off, but I find it interesting, and it’s part of what motivated me to take on this project in the first place.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What’s this all about?</title><link href="//navabhidhamma/intro/2019/06/15/what-is-this.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What's this all about?" /><published>2019-06-15T11:27:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-15T11:27:00-04:00</updated><id>//navabhidhamma/intro/2019/06/15/what-is-this</id><content type="html" xml:base="//navabhidhamma/intro/2019/06/15/what-is-this.html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I updated the About and Index pages, so that should sum up what I’m doing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the best thing now would be to simply outline my academic-ish goals (I doubt I’ll ever be involved in academia proper again) as far as Buddhist studies goes.  I should emphasize that I am a practitioner, as well, so my central goal in all of this is to provide illumination for further practice that could be helpful to those who engage the material on an intellectual level.  Of course, that is dangerous, because it’s easy for us to get caught up in our ideas and lose the practice…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I would like primarily to be deeply familiar with the EBTs, whether in Pāli, Sanskrit, Chinese, or Tibetan…or Gandhāri or any other language.  Pāli is, of course, my starting point, but I intend to avail myself of Bhante Bhikkhu Anālayo’s research some time in the future of this project.  Ideally, I’d find a way to tie this in with Ajahn Bhikkhu Sujato’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suttacentral.net&quot;&gt;Sutta Central&lt;/a&gt;.  I would like a broader familiarity with the early schools, in part because of how they shed light on what was being thought about the original teachings, in part because of how they contribute to the rise of Mahāyāna, and in part because of my own practice.  I would like to be conversant in Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, and in their Chinese (and Chinese-influenced) and Tibetan elaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current to-do list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish the early suttas (perhaps read the rest of the canon?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finish the Pāli reader (after which perhaps I’ll be ready to start in earnest)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read:  &lt;em&gt;The Buddhist Path of Awakening&lt;/em&gt; by Gethin, Ven Anālayo’s &lt;em&gt;From Craving to Grasping&lt;/em&gt; and the next volume, &lt;em&gt;The Great Disciples of the Buddha&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Life of the Buddha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
