title: The Grand Plan
---

This is the current plan for the preliminary studies leading to the actual meat of the work on this project.

1. <s>Finish the EBTs.</s>
2. Finish some other preliminary stuff.
    - *The Great Disciples of the Buddha*
    - *The Life of the Buddha* (Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli)
    - *The Buddhist Path of Awakening* (Gethin)
    - *From Craving to Grasping* and *From Grasping to Emptiness* (Bhikkhu Anālayo)
    - *A Swift Pair of Messengers*
3. Exploration of Theravāda.
    - *Abhidhamma Studies*
    - *A Guide to the Abhidhamma*
    - *Concept and Reality*
    - *A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma*
    - *The Path of Purification*
    - *Living Dharma Masters*
4. Indian philosophy in general.  Need to understand the context of the development of Buddhist thought.  For this, I'll simply read *A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy*.
5. Early Buddhist Schools.  For this, turn to Hirakawa to find the best sources.
6. Indian Mahāyāna:  The Sūtras, Madhyāmaka and Yogācārā, Tathāgathagarbha, and any related topics.
7. Indian Tantra.
8. East Asian Buddhism.  Start with China, then look at Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.  Before Chinese Buddhism, though, get a quick overview of Chinese philosophy.
9. Tibetan Buddhism.
