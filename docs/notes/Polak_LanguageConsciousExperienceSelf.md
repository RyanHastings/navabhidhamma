title: Notes on "Language, Conscious Experience and the Self in Early Buddhism"
---

Polak, Grzegorz. 2018.  "Language, Conscious Experience, and the Self in Early Buddhism.  A Cross-cultural Interdisciplinary Study."
*JOCBS*.  pp. 37-76.

The author examines the value of investigating the EBTs, and of taking an interdisciplinary approach with cognitive science.  He outlines
a model of the human being as a complex system of independent cognitive processes, and discusses the role language plays in shaping our
experience (drawing heavy connections with Wittgenstein).
