Wynne, Alexander, 2010:  "The ātman and its negation: A Conceptual and chronological analysis of early Buddhist thought."  *Journal
of the International Association of Buddhist Studies.* _33_ (1-2), pp 103-171.

This paper purports to trace the history of the concept of the No Self doctrine in Buddhism.  It basically sees the doctrine as
most likely starting with a Not Self doctrine, rooted in epistemological conditioning--i.e., the self (and indeed space and time itself)
originate as experiences conditioned by sense contact and sensation.  The doctrine evolved into one of a reductionist realism (eventually
explicated in the Abhidhamma), the No Self doctrine, in which what is taken to be a "self" is made of real, irreducible parts.

After noting the central importance of the No Self doctrine in our current understanding of Buddhism, he notes that the *Vajīra Sutta*
(SN 5.10) is one of the only suttas to mention the doctrine specifically:  "There is nothing but a heap of formations: No being is found
here.  When there is a collection of parts the word 'chariot' is used; In the same way, when the aggregates exist the conventional
term 'being' is applied to them."  The fact that this doctrine, so central to later Buddhist philosophy, is largely absent from the suttas
leads Wynne to pose a historical question:  What changed?  He sees that either this doctrine was implicit in most of the EBTs, 
and later made explicit, or that the doctrine was a minority doctrine or did not exist, and was formulated later.

He turns to what is likely the first formulation of the Not Self teaching:  The Second Sermon.  In particular, he draws our attention
to a passage containing an argument that is oft repeated:  That the aggregates cannot be taken as a self (*attan*) because they are
*anicca* and *dukkha*...two qualities that would make them different from the *ātman* in the metaphysical sense as stated in the Upaniṣads.
Wynne suggests, however, that *sukha* understood as "bliss" is a property of the macrocosmic unification of *ātman* and *brahman*, which
is not what this passage discusses.  This passage is about the personal experience of the aggregates and of the self.  It essentially
demonstrates that no intrinsic self can be found among the conditioned, phenomenal experiences one might appropriate as self.  It is *not* a metaphysical
statement, nor is it even a denial that the self in some sense exists.  From this, Wynne takes a look at the nature of self-consciousness in the EBTs, in general.  He sees that identifying with a subjectivity is itself a cognitive and affective source of suffering, and subjectivity, along with
all views, arise from conditioned experience.
