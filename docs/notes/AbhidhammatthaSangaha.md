title: Notes on Abhidhammattha Sangaha
---

Composed somewhere between the 5th and 12th century, probably in the 10th-12th range, this is basically a summary of what had become a vast literature on the Theravāda Abhidhamma.

# Compendium of Consciousness

This chapter goes over the various types of *citta* that can arise.  The total is either 89 or 121, depending on how one counts the Lokuttara cittas.

## Sense-Sphere Consciousness (54)

These are forms of citta that arise in the sense-sphere (the other spheres being the form sphere and the formless sphere).

### Unwholesome Consciousness (12)

The twelve Unwholesome consciousnesses are all rooted in either greed, hate, or delusion.  Eight types are rooted in greed, depending on whether or not they are accompanied by pleasurable or neutral feeling, whether they are prompted or unprompted, and whether they are connected with wrong view or not.  Two types are rooted in hatred, both accompanied by unpleasant feelings and connected to aversion, either prompted or unprompted.  Two types are rooted in delusion, both accompanied by neutral feeling, one associated with doubt, the other with restlessness.  All of these are karmically active, i.e., they produce bad results.

### Rootless Consciousness (18)

These are consciousnesses that have no roots.  They are all either resultant consciousnesses (wholesome or unwholesome) or functional (not karmically active).  There are seven unwholesome resultant consciousnesses, the first four of which are neutral-feeling sensory consciousnesses (*viññāṇā*), one of which is an unpleasant feeling bodily sense-consciousness, and two additional consciousnesses with neutral feeling:  A receiving and an investigating.  More or these later, but these represent particular cognitive functions.  There are eight wholesome resultant consciousnesses.  They are like the seven unwholesome resultant, except the bodily sensation consciousness can be pleasant or neutral (and not painful).  Finally, there are three rootless functional consciousnesses:  the five sense-door adverting consciousnesses and the mind-door adverting consciousness (both neutral-feeling) and the smile-producing consciousness peculiar to arahants.

### Beautiful Consciousness of the Sense Sphere (24)

Eight of these consciousnesses are karmically active and rooted in wholesome roots.  They are either accompanied by joy or neutral, prompted or unprompted, and connected with knowledge or not.  An identical eight are resultant consciousnesses, and another eight are sense-sphere functional consciousnesses.  

## Form-Sphere Consciousness (15)

The five rūpajhānas (by the Abhidhamma accounting), in either wholesome, resultant, or functional form.  Resultant occurs only for beings that have been born into the Form Realm.  

## Formless Consciousness (12)

The arūpajhānas, threefold as with the rūpajhānas.

## Supramundane Consciousness (8)

Each of the four path and fruit consciousnesses for the four levels of awakening.  These only last one mind-moment.
