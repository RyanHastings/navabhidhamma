Notes on [Bhikkhu Anālayo, "The *Mahācattārīsaka-sutta* in the Light of its Parallels--Tracing the Beginnings of Abhidharmic Thought, JCBSSL Vol VIII, pp 59-93"](https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/mahacattarisaka.pdf).

Bhante Anālayo offers a comparison between the Theravāda *Mahācattārīsaka-sutta*, "The Discourse on the Great Forty", what is likely the
Sarvāstivādin "Discourse on the Noble Path", translated from Sanskrit to Chinese and contained within the *Madhyama-āgama*, and the
(Mūla-)Sarvāstivādin "The Great Forty", *chen po bzhi bcu*, in Tibetan, found as a quotation in the commentary on the *Abhidharmakośa*.  In
the text, he offers a full translation of "Discourse on the Noble Path".

Overall, he makes some observations:

+ In the Pāli version, there is mention of a "mundane" vs "supramundane" version of each of the path factors.  This is not present in the Chinese
or Tibetan recensions.  This is also not present anywhere else in the Pāli suttas, however it is a feature of the Abhidhamma.

+ The Pāli and Tibetan lack the elaboration of the ninth and tenth path factors (right liberation and right knowledge), which the Chinese has.

+ The Pāli does not include an elaboration of right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration following the discussion of the
other path factors, which the other two do.

+ When discussing path factors 6-8, the Chinese and Tibetan do not discuss how they tie together, which was the theme of the bulk of the text (how
each of path factors 1-5 are supported by effort and mindfulness, and how they come together to support concentration).

+ The elaboration of path factors 6-8 in the Tibetan uses a string of near synonyms, stylistically similar to the Abhidharma.  The Chinese,
on the other hand, uses standard formulations of the four right efforts, the four establishings of mindfulness, and the four jhāna.

+ The Pāli and Tibetan agree on the title.

+ The Pāli and Tibetan agree on putting the sequential build-up of the path factors after the discussion of each, unlike the Chinese.

+ The Pāli and Tibetan include the "existence of spontaneously arise beings" as part of right view.

From this, Bhante Anālayo concludes that the Pāli version is the closest to the original, but the supramundane vs mundane division has been
added, with the development of Abhidhammic thought.  He demonstrated that this division was present within the Chinese tradition by translating
two sūtras from the Saṃyukta-āgama (SĀ 785 and 789) but did not make its way into "Discourse on the Noble Path".  He also concludes that the
Chinese and Tibetan versions come from fairly independent lines of transmission, as both seem to have taken the original and made their own
modifications.  In the case of the Chinese, adding the standard formulae for right effort through right knowledge, and in the case of the Tibetan
adding an Abhidharmic style description of right effort through right concentration.
