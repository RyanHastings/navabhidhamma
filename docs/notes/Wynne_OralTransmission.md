title:  Notes on "The Oral Transmission of Early Buddhist Literature"
---

Wynne, Alexander.  2004.  "The Oral Transmission of Early Buddhist Literature."  *Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies.*
Vol 27(1), pp. 97-128.

Wynne first reviews that there are two primary theories for the oral transmission of Buddhist literature:  That the literature was primarily
improvisational (*a la* Homer) or that it was strictly controlled.  He reviews textual evidence for both of these claims.  Primarily is the
notion of the four sources of authenticity (*mahƒÅpadesa*).  In addition, there are numerous places where it is clear that the teachings must
be learned down to the letter.  Also, there were communal recitations, which does not lend itself to improvisation and instead requires a
fixed passage.
