I am working towards building a reference to various elements of the Sutta Piṭaka.  Of course, to really do that right, I'm going to need a substantial amount of preliminary knowledge of Pāli and the suttas, which I currently lack.  In the months until I feel both my Pāli and my familiarity with the suttas is sufficient, this will simply be a blog detailing my studies, musings, and goals.  It could be considered the scholarly complement to my practice-oriented blog, [Dhamma-Vinaya](http://dhamma-vinaya.dreamwidth.com).
