The texts in the Sutta Piṭaka are built from a fixed set of stock phrases, or *pericopes*.  While perusing them, I have often wished for some sort of an encyclopedic concordance of pericopes, connecting the various sutta references and giving some degree of context.  Perhaps it could also include particularly vivid similes, which the Blessed One was so fond of using.  As far as I know, no such reference work exists, so I have decided to make one for myself and for what I now with tongue in cheek refer to as neo-Abhidhammikas, that is, those of us engaging in modernist forms of Buddhism, interpreting or re-interpreting the texts and teachings in light of our world and our experiences for the purpose of putting them into practice.

This is a daunting task, of course, and I'm not even near being able to begin it!  At the time of writing this, I am about a year into Pāli lessons recorded by Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi, and on a mission to read the entirety of what is considered the early part of the Sutta Piṭaka:  The first four Nikāyas, the *Dhammapāda*, *Therigatha*, *Theragatha*, *Udāna*, *Sutta Nipata*, and *Itivutakka.*  Once I feel I have reached an adequate place with those initial studies, I'll review the basics of natural language processing, and begin putting together the concordances!  I envision one directory devoted to the pericopes, one to similes, and one more traditional word-based concordance.  While doing that, I will also do my best to avail myself of what academic literature is available to make sure my work is accurate to the best of current knowledge in Buddhist studies.
