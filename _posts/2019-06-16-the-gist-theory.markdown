I'm not immersed enough in the scholarship of Buddhism to know how whack Bhante Sujato's GIST theory is, but I find it interesting, and it's part of what motivated me to take on this project in the first place.

He presents it in his [A History of Mindfulness](http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_History_of_Mindfulness_Bhikkhu_Sujato.pdf), in which he traces the development of the idea of mindfulness and its eventual expression in the satipaṭṭhāna literature.  The first half of the book is devoted to his proposition of a theory to explain the earliest development of Buddhist teachings, which he refers to as the GIST theory:  The General Integrated Sutta Theory.  To come up with it, he looks at three strata of early literature:  The suttas themselves, the collections of suttas, and the Abhidhamma, and considers them independently to see what light they shed on the origin of the canon.

I find the level of the collection of the suttas the most interesting.  He proposes that the first collection was four of the five Vaggas of the Saṃyutta Nikāya/Saṃyukta Āgama.  He suggests the Four Noble Truths provided a scaffolding for the core organization of the suttas, and from there, the other collections and longer suttas were composed and built.  He also proposes that some of the earliest Abhidhamma literature, such as the *Vibhaṅga*, predates the later Nikāya literature, such as the *Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.*

I hope to be able to carry out statistical studies to flesh out these ideas a bit more.  I anticipate another year of learning before being able to do this, though.
