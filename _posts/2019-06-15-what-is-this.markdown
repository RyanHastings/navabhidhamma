Well, I updated the About and Index pages, so that should sum up what I'm doing here.

So perhaps the best thing now would be to simply outline my academic-ish goals (I doubt I'll ever be involved in academia proper again) as far as Buddhist studies goes.  I should emphasize that I am a practitioner, as well, so my central goal in all of this is to provide illumination for further practice that could be helpful to those who engage the material on an intellectual level.  Of course, that is dangerous, because it's easy for us to get caught up in our ideas and lose the practice...

Anyway, I would like primarily to be deeply familiar with the EBTs, whether in Pāli, Sanskrit, Chinese, or Tibetan...or Gandhāri or any other language.  Pāli is, of course, my starting point, but I intend to avail myself of Bhante Bhikkhu Anālayo's research some time in the future of this project.  Ideally, I'd find a way to tie this in with Ajahn Bhikkhu Sujato's [Sutta Central](http://www.suttacentral.net).  I would like a broader familiarity with the early schools, in part because of how they shed light on what was being thought about the original teachings, in part because of how they contribute to the rise of Mahāyāna, and in part because of my own practice.  I would like to be conversant in Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, and in their Chinese (and Chinese-influenced) and Tibetan elaborations.

My current to-do list:
- Finish the early suttas (perhaps read the rest of the canon?)
- Finish the Pāli reader (after which perhaps I'll be ready to start in earnest)
- Read:  *The Buddhist Path of Awakening* by Gethin, Ven Anālayo's *From Craving to Grasping* and the next volume, *The Great Disciples of the Buddha*, and *The Life of the Buddha*
