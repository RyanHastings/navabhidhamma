I just wanted to give a quick updated on progress.  I've been in the process of moving, so my Pāli lessons
have been neglected, but I intend to re-start those this week by re-doing lesson five from the reader.  I
finished the *Saṃyutta Nikāya* and have moved on to the *Aṅguttara Nikāya*, and am now in the fifth nipāta.
It's generally pretty great stuff!
