Still chugging along the reading project.  Finished the *Aṅguttara Nikāya*, and have moved on to
the *Kuddhaka Nikāya*.  In order, it will be:  *Dhammapada*, *Udāna*, *Itivuttaka*, *Sutta Nipāta*,
*Theragātha*, and *Therigātha*.  I was fortunate to find all of those on the free shelf at Forest
Dhamma a few days ago, Ajaan Geoff's translations.  Then I move on to Gethin's *Wings of Awakening*,
Sujato's *A Swift Pair of Messengers*, the book on the Buddha's disciples, and whatever else is in
that reading list...*Concept and Reality* and *Life of the Buddha*, I think?
