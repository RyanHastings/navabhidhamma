In the last few weeks, a tectonic shift has occurred in my life, and in my approach to the project
described herein.  I have decided to go into Buddhist Studies, professionally.  The precise road
is not yet clear to me, whether it be my current trajectory of doing it in my spare time and hoping
some day to only work part-time, or ordaining as a monastic, or (my current fantasy) returning to
graduate school.  All that is clear to me is that I *must* move forward with this.

To that end, I have begun making contacts within the world.  Given my skills--and indeed it seems
my whole life has been leading to this--the best place for me to go seems to be the use of
quantitative methods to support text-critical analysis.  I will assist in developing the neural
networks and algorithms for finding parallels within the corpus of Buddhist canonical material,
but also use that for my own research into topics of interest (that I have every bit of confidence
will come up as I continue down this path).  In the last week or two, I have had a Skype call with
Bhikkhu Sujato and a Zoom call with Venerable Vimala.  The latter gave me a wealth of material to
look over (although most of it directly pertained to the Tibetan canon).

In addition, I printed out several articles by Wynne, and one article by Bhikkhu Anālayo.  I have
a fair amount of catch-up to do.

As far as my original reading plan goes, I am currently in the midst of the *Itivutakka*, so I am
closing in on the project of reading the EBTs from the Pāli canon.  All that remains is the
*Sutta-Nipāta*, the *Theragatha*, and the *Therigatha*.
