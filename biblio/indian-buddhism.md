title: Indian Buddhism

These are texts specifically about Indian Buddhism, including those about the Buddha himself.

## About the Buddha Himself

### Gombrich, Richard, 1996. *How Buddhism Began*

A nice companion to *What the Buddha Thought*, Gombrich considers the historical and philosophical background in which the Buddha was born.

### Gombrich, Richard, 2009. *What the Buddha Thought*

Good for those familiar with the basics of Buddhism already.  It's a very readable style, but highly speculative, underlining the idea that we should read the EBTs in light of their historical context.  Gombrich argues that the Buddha was embedded in and responding to contemporary Indian philosophy, and some of his teachings are best understood in that light.

## About Indian Philosophy in General

### Williams, Paul with Anthony Tribe, 2000.  *Buddhist Thought*

A thorough, historical introduction to Indian Buddhism, covering more or less the same time period as Hirakawa, but without presenting all of the evidence, and thus somewhat more accessible.

### Hirakawa Akira, 1990.  *A History of Early Indian Buddhism*

A detailed survey of the development of Buddhism in India from the Buddha himself up to the beginning of Tantric Buddhism.  Probably not the best introductory text because of the detail of archaeological evidence used, but very thorough after one has read a more introductory text.

## About Indian Languages

### Kaprik, Stefan, 2019.  "The Buddha Taught in Pali: A working hypothesis".  *The Journal for the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies*, **16**: 10-86.

A look at the arguments for Pāli being an artificial language built from several natural Prakrits, a rejection of those arguments, and an argument for the language that evolved into what we now call Pāli being the language of the Buddha's original teaching.

## Early Buddhism

[Bhikkhu Anālayo, "The *Mahācattārīsaka-sutta* in the Light of its Parallels--Tracing the Beginnings of Abhidharmic Thought, JCBSSL Vol VIII, pp 59-93"](../docs/notes/Analayo_MahaccatarisakaSuttaAbhidharma.md).  A comparison of three parallels to "Discourse on the Great Forty"

[Polak, Grzegorz. 2018.  "Language, Conscious Experience, and the Self in Early Buddhism.  A Cross-cultural Interdisciplinary Study."
*JOCBS*.  pp. 37-76.](../docs/notes/Polak_LanguageConsciousExperienceSelf.html)  The author examines the value of investigating the EBTs, and of taking an interdisciplinary approach with cognitive science.  He outlines
a model of the human being as a complex system of independent cognitive processes, and discusses the role language plays in shaping our
experience (drawing heavy connections with Wittgenstein).

Wynne, Alexander. 2002.  "An interpretation of 'released on both sides' (*ubhato-bhāga-vimutti*), and the ramifications for the study of early Buddhism."  *Buddhist Studies Review*, 19, 1 pp 31-40.  Wynne looks at two different accounts of the Buddha's awakening, by meditation and by insight  This forwards an argument that he develops in later papers that the canonical literature is not homogenous, but contains records of early debates that had begun to emerge in the community before splitting into schools.

[Wynne, Alexander.  2004.  "The Oral Transmission of Early Buddhist Literature."  *Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies.*
Vol 27(1), pp. 97-128.](../docs/notes/Wynne_OralTransmission.html).  A look at two theories of oral transmission of the EBTs, improvisational and
fixed, and argument that the latter is correct.

[Wynne, Alexander, 2010:  "The ātman and its negation: A Conceptual and chronological analysis of early Buddhist thought."  *Journal
of the International Association of Buddhist Studies.* _33_ (1-2), pp 103-171.](../docs/notes/Wynne_AtmanNegation.html)  A proposal that the
emergence of a No Self doctrine from a prior Not Self doctrine represents a transition from the Buddha's experience beyond all conditioned
phenomenon to the reductionist realism of the Abhidhamma.

Wynne, Alexander, 2010:  "The Buddha's 'skill in means' and the genesis of the five aggregate teaching."  *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Series 3*, 20, 2, pp. 191-216.  To bolster the argument that the Buddha did not formulate the entirety of the Dhamma at one moment, but instead his teaching evolved over his life, Wynne finds a sutta in which the Buddha seemingly changes teaching mid-speech, constructing the five aggregates through the course of the teaching.

Wynne, Alexander, 2015:  "Early Buddhist Teaching as proto-śunyavāda." *JOCBS* 2015(11):213-241.  By unearthing the fact that the Buddha's realization is beyond conception, and that the entirety of the world of experience is a cognitive construction, he identifies an anti-realist strain, but it is countered by a 'constructed realism' that identifies regularities, patterns in how that construction occurs.  Ultimately, it prefigures the later Mahāyāna ideas of śunya.  He identifies 'anti-realism' as 'no view' and 'constructed realism' as 'correct view'.

Wynne, Alexander, 2019:  "Did the Buddha exist?" *JOCBS* 2019(16): 98-148.  Wynne tackles the question of whether or not the Buddha existed.  He addresses the arguments of radical skeptics and what qualifies as evidence.  It more or less covers the same ground as Brahmali and Sujato's book on the topic, drawing out some of the arguments for the person of the Buddha in a bit more detail, i.e., his idiosyncracies and the idea that he could not have been designed by a committee.

Wynne, Alexander, 2019:  "Further thoughts on the 'two paths thesis'." *JOCBS* 2019(16): 149-162.  Because the canon contains more than the Buddha's teachings, but continued to be redacted long after the parinibbāna, it necessarily contains the views of various monastics or groups of monastics about what the teachings were.  These views may have eventually been more developed in the Abhidhamma or commentaries, but traces can be found in the EBTs themselves.
