These are texts specifically about Indian Buddhism, including those about the Buddha himself.

## About the Buddha Himself

### Gombrich, Richard. *How Buddhism Began*

A nice companion to *What the Buddha Thought*, Gombrich considers the historical and philosophical background in which the Buddha was born.

### Gombrich, Richard. *What the Buddha Thought*

Good for those familiar with the basics of Buddhism already.  It's a very readable style, but highly speculative, underlining the idea that we should read the EBTs in light of their historical context.  Gombrich argues that the Buddha was embedded in and responding to contemporary Indian philosophy, and some of his teachings are best understood in that light.

## About Indian Philosophy in General

### Hirakawa Akira.  *A History of Early Indian Buddhism*

A detailed survey of the development of Buddhism in India from the Buddha himself up to the beginning of Tantric Buddhism.  Probably not the best introductory text because of the detail of archaeological evidence used, but very thorough after one has read a more introductory text.
