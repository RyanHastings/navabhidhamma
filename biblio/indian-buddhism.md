These are texts specifically about Indian Buddhism, including those about the Buddha himself.

## About the Buddha Himself

### Gombrich, Richard, 1996. *How Buddhism Began*

A nice companion to *What the Buddha Thought*, Gombrich considers the historical and philosophical background in which the Buddha was born.

### Gombrich, Richard, 2009. *What the Buddha Thought*

Good for those familiar with the basics of Buddhism already.  It's a very readable style, but highly speculative, underlining the idea that we should read the EBTs in light of their historical context.  Gombrich argues that the Buddha was embedded in and responding to contemporary Indian philosophy, and some of his teachings are best understood in that light.

## About Indian Philosophy in General

### Williams, Paul with Anthony Tribe, 2000.  *Buddhist Thought*

A thorough, historical introduction to Indian Buddhism, covering more or less the same time period as Hirakawa, but without presenting all of the evidence, and thus somewhat more accessible.

### Hirakawa Akira, 1990.  *A History of Early Indian Buddhism*

A detailed survey of the development of Buddhism in India from the Buddha himself up to the beginning of Tantric Buddhism.  Probably not the best introductory text because of the detail of archaeological evidence used, but very thorough after one has read a more introductory text.

## About Indian Languages

### Kaprik, Stefan, 2019.  "The Buddha Taught in Pali: A working hypothesis".  *The Journal for the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies*, **16**: 10-86.

A look at the arguments for Pāli being an artificial language built from several natural Prakrits, a rejection of those arguments, and an argument for the language that evolved into what we now call Pāli being the language of the Buddha's original teaching.

## Early Buddhism

[Bhikkhu Anālayo, "The *Mahācattārīsaka-sutta* in the Light of its Parallels--Tracing the Beginnings of Abhidharmic Thought, JCBSSL Vol VIII, pp 59-93"](../docs/notes/Analayo_MahaccatarisakaSuttaAbhidharma.md).  A comparison of three parallels to "Discourse on the Great Forty"

[Polak, Grzegorz. 2018.  "Language, Conscious Experience, and the Self in Early Buddhism.  A Cross-cultural Interdisciplinary Study."
*JOCBS*.  pp. 37-76.](../docs/notes/Polak_LanguageConsciousExperienceSelf.html)  The author examines the value of investigating the EBTs, and of taking an interdisciplinary approach with cognitive science.  He outlines
a model of the human being as a complex system of independent cognitive processes, and discusses the role language plays in shaping our
experience (drawing heavy connections with Wittgenstein).

[Wynne, Alexander.  2004.  "The Oral Transmission of Early Buddhist Literature."  *Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies.*
Vol 27(1), pp. 97-128.](../docs/notes/Wynne_OralTransmission.html).  A look at two theories of oral transmission of the EBTs, improvisational and
fixed, and argument that the latter is correct.

[Wynne, Alexander, 2010:  "The ātman and its negation: A Conceptual and chronological analysis of early Buddhist thought."  *Journal
of the International Association of Buddhist Studies.* _33_ (1-2), pp 103-171.](../docs/notes/Wynne_AtmanNegation.html)  A proposal that the
emergence of a No Self doctrine from a prior Not Self doctrine represents a transition from the Buddha's experience beyond all conditioned
phenomenon to the reductionist realism of the Abhidhamma.
