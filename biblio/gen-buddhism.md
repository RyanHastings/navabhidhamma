These are books about Buddhism, in general.

### Robinson, Richard, Willard L. Johnson and Sandra A. Wawrytko, 1997.  *The Buddhist Religion:  A Historical Introduction*

An excellent overview of Buddhist thought, taken from a historical perspective.  This text considers the Buddhism of all major Buddhist countries.  Great introduction for beginners looking for a broad, informative, non-technical introduction.
